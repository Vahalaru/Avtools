Personal Project

  Hey guys, I started this app quite a few months back. Hell I started out having a hard time getting a Spinner to populate correctly. So if it is a little rough thats why.  I would love to hear some suggestions on things I could Improve. As of right now it has
  1. Navigation Drawer
  2. Tabbed Layout for different Calculater percentages
  3. Activity to add a new plane and info to the database that syncs to everyones
  4. A RecyclerView of CardViews which Inflates 2 different views dependent on the type of plane
  5. Activity that gets the current server Data for an object i.e. "Plane" and updates to the database
  6. Anytime the app has a newer version posted to my website it will ask if you want to update and if so will update the app for you.
